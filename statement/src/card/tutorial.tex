This was the hardest problem in the problem set we thought, but participant Feng Weiming, passed the problem in 98 minutes. Surprising!

We may enumerate the last card drawn, remove the card and make a dynamic programming. Let $f(i, j)$ denote the probability of drawing $j$ cards out of the first $i$ cards. The transition is some combinatorial work and can be done in cubic time, so the total time complexity is $O(n^4)$.
