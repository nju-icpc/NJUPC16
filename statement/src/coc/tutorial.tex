For Div.2, the length of the string is proportional to the $n$-th Fibonacci number, which grows in $O(1.619^n)$, so direct construction of the string may fit in time limit.

For Div.1, consider solving this problem characterwise. That is, given $n$ and $k$, one have to find the $k$-th character in $S(n)$. This can be solved by a simple recursive method, by preprocessing the length of each $S(i)$.
